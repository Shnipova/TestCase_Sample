# 📁 QA Test Cases & Bug Reports – Sample Documentation

This repository includes examples of how I write test cases and document bugs in a structured and consistent way. These samples are intended to demonstrate QA best practices, attention to detail, and techniques used to maintain product quality throughout the testing cycle.

## 🧩 Test Case Writing Approach

- **Structured Format**: All test cases follow a consistent layout:  
  `Test ID`, `Title`, `Preconditions`, `Steps`, `Expected Result`, `Actual Result`, `Status`, `Severity`, `Priority`.

- **Clarity First**: Each step is written to be **easily followed** by any tester or stakeholder without prior knowledge of the feature.

- **Risk-Based Testing**: Test cases are prioritized based on potential impact to users or system flow.

- **Reusable Steps**: Common actions (e.g., login) are modularized for easy reuse across multiple test cases.

- **Cross-Device Checks**: Separate columns or tags for desktop vs. mobile checks (useful for responsive UI).

## 🐞 Bug Reporting Style

- **Complete Reproduction Steps**: All bugs are reported with clear steps that can be followed by developers with minimal back-and-forth.

- **Consistent Templates**: Bug reports follow the same structure across platforms (Jira, YouTrack, ZephyrScale).

- **Critical Thinking**: Bugs are evaluated in terms of severity, business impact, and visibility to end users.

- **Attached Evidence**:
  - Screenshots with highlighted areas
  - Screen recordings when needed
  - Network logs (for API issues)
  - Device/environment info (especially for mobile-specific issues)

## 🔍 What I Focus On First

When testing or reporting bugs, I typically prioritize:

- **Core functionality** and high-impact user flows
- **Input validation** (especially on forms and user-generated content)
- **Edge cases** and unexpected inputs
- **UI consistency** across browsers/devices
- **Error handling** and response messaging
- **API responses** (status codes, body content, response times)

## ✅ Summary

These examples aim to show how test documentation and bug reporting can be:

- Easy to follow  
- Detailed but not overwhelming  
- Consistently structured  
- Developer-friendly  
- Focused on real-world impact
